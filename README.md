# DataXFinalProject

This is a team project I did at Berkeley for IEOR290 Data-X with Tu Ni, Fu-Chi Shih, and Xinle Wang.

Our goal is to evaluate and predict basketball player's potential performance in NBA, based on their college basketball performances and other attributes, to enable scouts, coaches and managers select the best available players from drafting.

We scraped statistics of 1,200 NBA players drafted from NCAA since 1990 with 26 features using Beautiful Soup, and constructed linear regressions, logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting in Python.

The most important four features from our models are: steals, points, rebounds, and blocks.
